### One Planet Associates

For One Planet Associates, we developed a fast, professional, and highly optimised website, tailored to showcase their sustainable energy consultancy services. By building the site with **Gatsby**, we took advantage of static site generation (SSG), providing a significant boost in performance and SEO, ensuring lightning-fast load times and high Lighthouse scores for improved search rankings. This approach also enhances user experience, particularly for mobile visitors.

We integrated **Contentful** as the headless CMS, which gave the client a powerful yet intuitive platform to manage content without needing technical expertise. This flexibility means they can effortlessly update project information and resources, keeping the site fresh and relevant for visitors.

The website is hosted on **Netlify**, chosen for its seamless CI/CD pipeline, reliability, and ability to deliver static content efficiently. This solution ensures that the site remains fast, scalable, and secure, with automatic builds triggered whenever content is updated.

From a design perspective, we maintained One Planet Associates' brand identity, delivering a clean, professional layout that communicates their expertise in renewable energy planning. The simple yet effective **contact page** was strategically placed to encourage client inquiries, with a user-friendly interface designed for easy navigation across devices.

This project is a prime example of how combining Gatsby, Contentful, and Netlify can deliver a high-performance, SEO-friendly website that is easy to manage and future-proof. The result is a site that not only reflects the clientâ€™s brand but also provides an optimal user experience, ensuring continued growth and visibility online.
