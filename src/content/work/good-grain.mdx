### Custom Lightbox Product Setup for Good Grain

We assisted Good Grain in setting up a product customizer app for their custom lightbox collection. By configuring the app, we enabled customers to personalize their lightboxes with text, colours, and fonts, offering a user-friendly and interactive shopping experience. This set-up seamlessly integrates with Good Grainâ€™s website, supporting their brand's focus on customization and sustainable design.
