Seriously Silly Socks is a vibrant e-commerce brand specializing in fun, quirky, and stylish socks for all occasions. They wanted to expand their sales via their DTC site to Europe and beyond.

### Drawer Space Invaders!!

The client wanted something unique to engage customers, so we made a special game for them! _Only Ewe Can Save The World_! A quirky game where a sheep shoots socks out fo the sky... why not!?
Customers can play to win discounts and prizes. High socres are saved to the store via a custom app that updates a metafield on the store.

  sizes={`(min-width: 860px) 1000px, 100vw`}
/>

### Product subscriptions

A sock subscription will keep your drawer inundated with new socks every month. We set up a subscription service for the client using Shopify's native subscription app. This allows customers to subscribe to a monthly sock delivery and manage their subscription from their account. They'll receive different designs everymonth to keep that new sock feeling going all year long!

### Developing International Markets

Customers should be able to shop in their own language and their own curreny, no matter where the. For this, we set up multiple Markets to enable tailored shipping and currencies for the customer's location. We also translated all of the site content for 5 different languages.
