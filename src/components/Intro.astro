      Hi! Web developer with six years of professional experience, currently
      expanding my skills into full-stack development. I enjoy building fast,
      accessible websites and applications, with a particular focus on modern
      JavaScript, React, and Shopify development. I'm always learning and keen
      to take on new challenges that help me grow as a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently completed a full-stack development course where we focused on
      agile working methodologies, Python, and Django. This gave me a solid
      foundation in building full-stack applications and working collaboratively
      using modern development practices.
